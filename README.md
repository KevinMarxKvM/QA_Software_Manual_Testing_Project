## Introduction

This project is a demonstration of manual software testing skills using OpenCart, an online store management system based on PHP, MySQL, and HTML components.

### Understanding and Explore the Functionality (FRS)

- Review the FRS Document for a basic understanding.
- Consult with the product manager, developers, and designers for clarification and better understanding.
- Allocate sufficient time to review the FRS document for an in-depth grasp of functionalities.

### Test Plan

- Utilize information from the FRS document and the project plan provided by management.
- Explore the Test Plan Document.
- The test plan should define:
  - Inclusions, exclusions, and test environments.
  - Test strategy (Manual Testing or Automation Testing).
  - Defect reporting procedures.
  - Roles and responsibilities.
  - Test schedule and deliverables.
  - Pricing (managed by the manager).
  - Entry and exit criteria.
  - Suspension and resumption criteria.
  - Tools and risk mitigation strategies.

### Writing Test Scenarios

- Use the Test Scenarios Document.
- Define project details, client information, reference documents, and creation and approval dates.
- Test scenarios should be comprehensive, including IDs, references, descriptions, priorities, and the number of test cases.

### Writing Test Cases, Reviews, and Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)

- Ensure the Version History is included in the test case template.
- Create separate test suites for each test scenario and populate them with test cases.

### Environment Setup and Build Deployment

- Set up a MySQL Database.
- Install an Apache server using XAMMP to facilitate web application deployment.
- Receive a release note document from developers, including instructions for application deployment and build details.

### Front End Store and Database URLs

- Front End Store URL: http://localhost/opencart/
- Database URL: http://localhost/phpmyadmin/

## Test Execution

- Ensure that test cases are prepared and the build is successfully installed.
- Perform smoke testing or sanity testing as a pre-requisite for testing.
- Follow the defined test cycle, as indicated in the test plan.
- Report any deviations from expected results as bugs.

### Bug Reporting and Tracking

- Use the provided Bug Report Template.
- Report bugs daily, including bug IDs, steps to reproduce, expected and actual results, severity, and priority.
- Consider using bug tracking tools like Jira or Bugzilla.

### Sanity Testing, Re-testing, and Regression Testing

- **Sanity Testing:** Quickly verify core functionalities in a new build.
- **Re-testing:** Confirm that reported defects have been fixed.
- **Regression Testing:** Ensure that new features or changes do not affect existing functionalities.

## Test Sign Off

- Review test cases and verify that defects are appropriately addressed.
- Ensure that the software meets acceptance criteria and quality standards.
- Confirm the completion of all test documentation.
- Seek approval from relevant stakeholders to indicate that testing is complete.
- Provide formal sign-off to indicate that the software is ready for release.
